### Created an app that is full-stack and takes in a message input from a user that has an account and puts the posted message in alphabetical order.

### Optimization: If given more time I would have made this more complex.

### Lesson Learned: I learned that I can create a full-stack application even though it can be complicated at times. I also learned how to use amongoDB effectively.
